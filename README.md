# RamenGo API

One platform so that the user can place a ramen order, choosing the types of broths and proteins in the dish, and make a order with that.

## üßæ Documentation

The documentation was written with Swagger and can be viwed when the app is runing in [{API_URL}/api#/](http://localhost:3000/api#/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

For the API to work, a port must be released for it, for this it is necessary to insert this a PORT environment variable

To use POST, PUT and DELETE routes of Proteins and Broths is necessary a API Key in environtment variables.

This key will be searched in the requisition header with the key "x-api-key". Therefore, is neceessary define your api key and incluude in the header for the routes mentioned above.

For the Postgres database is necessary a variable named DATABASE_URL to connect with your DB.

Then you must to run the Prisma migrations. Prisma is a ORM and help to make queries in DB. You can run the migrations in your terminal with that line:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

The .env file must to be in aplication root path, and de variable definition must to be like:

```dotenv
PORT=3000

API_KEY='YourApiKey'

DATABASE_URL= 'postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=SCHEMA'
```
